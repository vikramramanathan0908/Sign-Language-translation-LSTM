# SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION TO AUDIO AND TEXT USING DENSE AND LSTM LAYERS

# Abstract

<p>Deaf-Mute people face many hurdles in accomplishing menial tasks in their everyday life. One of those many hurdles is the ability to communicate with fellow human beings with sign language. Unfortunately, only 0.2% of the population use and practice ASL (American Sign Language). This brings about a gap between Deaf-Mute people and people wanting to communicate with them.
The proposed system “Sign Language Translation to audio and text” aims to bridge this gap and hopes it will help Deaf-Mute people to engage in conversations with the general populace. The system can be used as a tool for non native speakers to get familiar with the language. Using Dense and LSTM layers the system detects hand motion by plotting keypoints on the hand with the help of mediapipe holistics. The sign is subsequently converted to audio and text.</p>

# Conclusion

<p>The proposed approach is a tool to bridge the communication gap between non native and native ASL signers. We were able to convert ASL signs into readable text and coherent audio. The system has 92.17% accuracy for 5 signs using 3 dense and LSTM layers. The solution offered is feasible and efficient and with certain enhancements, it can become the standard for sign language recognition softwares.

The system can be converted into a bi-directional software wherein it is possible to implement converting speech into its corresponding ASL sign. The frontend of the software can be built using html/css/js and we can connect it to the backend using python eel library. The output of speech to sign can either be a picture, animation, or a video of the corresponding ASL sign.
